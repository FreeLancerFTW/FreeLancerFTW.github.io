							<h2>Effects of high NO2 Levles</h2>

						<p>The epidemiological studies provide some evidence that long-term NO2 exposure may decrease lung function and increase the risk of respiratory symptoms.</p><p>
Although there are fewer epidemiological studies on long-term respiratory effects of NO2 than those of particulate matter, new evidence has been provided in recent years. Both cross-sectional and longitudinal studies indicate an association between NO2 and lung function. The Southern California Children’s Study showed that lung function levels among 9 to 16 year old children were lower in communities with higher NO2 concentration . Lung function growth, evaluated in a longitudinal study, was also impaired among these children. The NO2 effect in the cohort study was robust when other pollutants (e.g. PM10 and O3) were included in the statistical model, but weakened when acid vapours (including NO2 derived nitric acid) were simultaneously considered. The cross-sectional SAPALDIA Study in Switzerland gives support to the association of NO2 exposure and lung function decrements among adults.</p>
